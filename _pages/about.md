I’m a PhD Candidate in Economics at Columbia University. My primary field is development economics, with a focus on agriculture/labor, environment, and information. **I am on the 2025–2026 job market.**

Prior to joining Columbia, I worked at MIT as a research support associate. In 2017, I received my BA from Boston College, where I double-majored in Economics and English (concentration in Creative Writing).

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, cooking, and going to museums. I'm a frequent visitor of the Morningside Farmer's Market. From 2017–2021, I spent most of my free time learning automotive repair and restoration.
