## Work in Progress

**Mobility, Information, and Climate Resilience: Evidence from India’s Rural Poor**  
with [Ricardo Pommer Muñoz](https://pommermunoz.io/)  
Presented at [NetMob Conference, World Bank (2024)](https://netmob.org/www24/)
[Extended Abstract](/files/netmob_extended_abstract.pdf)

> Agricultural communities in India are substantially vulnerable to weather shocks. Information on how to bear those shocks spreads slowly through potentially sparse and distant social networks. Using cellphone mobility and farmer help-line call data, we characterize farmer mobility during the planting season, identify isolated areas, and show how mobility interacts with information seeking in the face of adverse weather.

**Information Provision and Agricultural Productivity**  
with [Ricardo Pommer Muñoz](https://pommermunoz.io/)
[Slides](/files/kcc_slides.pdf)

> Information extension services are common in the developing world, but often “push” information regardless of demand. We study how information provision through a large agricultural call center in India — a “pull” service — affects agricultural productivity. Leveraging a shock to access from the consolidation of the call center to one phone number and variation in tower coverage, we find the call center led farmers to sow less land overall but produce more per unit area.

**Frictions in Information Diffusion Among Smallholder Farmers**  
with [Raissa Fabregas](https://sites.google.com/view/raissafabregas) and [Jack Willis](https://sites.google.com/view/jwillis/home?authuser=0)

> Smallholder farmers vary substantially in agricultural know-how, even within the same village. Do farmers value others’ information and, if so, what prevents its diffusion? We measure knowledge of, and willingness-to-pay for, such information, and test interventions to encourage diffusion and identify the corresponding frictions.
